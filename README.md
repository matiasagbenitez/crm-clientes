## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the server locally. To do this, run the following command in the terminal:

`npm run dev`

This will start the server and open a browser window with the application.

The *db.json* file serves as the database for the project and is accessed through an API using JSON server. If it's not installed globally, it can be installed with the command **npm install -g json-server**.

If you prefer to install it only for the project, run **npm install json-server** instead. After installation, open a separate terminal and execute 

`json-server --watch db.json` 

to run the server.
